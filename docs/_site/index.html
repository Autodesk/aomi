<p>The purpose of aomi is providing a data model, suitable for use in a continuous delivery pipeline, for operational secrets to be stored in Hashicorp <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>. This data model is expressed as <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> in a file (generally) named <a href="/aomi/secretfile"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Secretfile</code></a>.</p>

<p>The aomi tool itself is quite flexible, but can be used to enforce rigorous opinions upon how an organization chooses to leverage Vault. It currently supports a variety of means of representing <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/r/generic_secret.html">Generic</a> and <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/index.html">AWS</a> secrets. There is also limited support for other constructs such as audit logs and policies.</p>

<p>You can pull aomi from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/autodesk/aomi/">Docker Hub</a> and run it either on a workstation or within a continuous delivery pipeline. You can pass authentication information in through a variety of hints, but the easiest is to just use your already established Vault credentials.</p>

<p>This simple operation will display the aomi operations which are available. You need to have succesfully completed a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vault auth</code> operation for this to work.</p>
