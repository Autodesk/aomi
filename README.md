# Aomi: Opinionlessly Express Opinions on Vault

If you are new to `aomi`, please checkout our [documentation](https://autodesk.github.io/aomi) and you may be particularily interested in the [quickstart](https://autodesk.github.io/aomi/quickstart).

# Test

Run with: `make test`

Unit testing is performed with nosetests, simply add new python modules to the tests directory prefixed with `test_`. Integration testing is done with BATS and involves a standalone Vault server. These tests are located under `tests/integration`.
