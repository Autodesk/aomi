name: AWS Credentials Profile
help: This template will generate an AWS credentials file compatible with the CLI and other supported tools. The profile will be named as the AWS path, without the sts/creds element, joined by underscores. Note that any/all hyphens in the path will also be converted to underscores. Also note that this template is really only suitable for AWS secret backends.
